# StickiesDbConverter
Brief python script for exporting a StickiesDatabase file on macOS to a plain text file.

This has only been tested on Mojave against a StickiesDatabase file with one sticky note,
so be aware that there are issues with reading files on other operating systems depending
on how their StickiesDatabase file is formatted.
